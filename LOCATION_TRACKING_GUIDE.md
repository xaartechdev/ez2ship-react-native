# Location Tracking Implementation - Ez2ship App

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Core Services
- **locationTrackingService.ts**: Complete location tracking service with:
  - GPS permission handling (Android & iOS)
  - Background location tracking with 5-second intervals
  - Distance-based location updates (minimum 10 meters)
  - Automatic location buffer management
  - Error handling and logging

### 2. React Hook
- **useLocationTracking.ts**: React hook for automatic location tracking:
  - Automatic start/stop based on order status ('in_transit')
  - Easy integration with React components
  - Proper cleanup on component unmount

### 3. OrderDetailsScreen Integration
- **OrderDetailsScreen.tsx**: Modified to trigger location tracking:
  - Starts tracking when order status changes to 'in_transit'
  - Stops tracking when order is delivered
  - Proper logging for debugging

### 4. Platform Permissions
- **Android (AndroidManifest.xml)**:
  - ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
  - ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION  
  - ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION
  - FOREGROUND_SERVICE
- **iOS (Info.plist)**:
  - NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription
  - NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription

## 📦 Required Dependencies

You need to install these packages:
```bash
npm install @react-native-community/geolocation react-native-permissions
```

## 🔧 Post-Installation Steps

### 1. iOS Setup
After installing dependencies, run:
```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

### 2. Android Setup
No additional setup required - permissions are already configured.

### 3. Test Location Tracking
1. Change order status from 'pending' to 'in_transit'
2. Check console logs for location tracking start
3. Verify location updates are sent to server every 5 seconds
4. Complete delivery to stop tracking

## 🌍 API Integration

The location tracking service sends data to:
- **Endpoint**: `POST /driver/location-update`
- **Payload**:
```json
{
  "order_id": "string",
  "latitude": number,
  "longitude": number,
  "timestamp": "ISO string",
  "accuracy": number,
  "speed": number
}
```

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Order Status Change**: When driver changes order status to 'in_transit'
2. **Auto Start**: Location tracking automatically starts for that order
3. **Real-time Updates**: GPS location sent to server every 5 seconds
4. **Smart Filtering**: Only sends updates if moved >10 meters
5. **Auto Stop**: Tracking stops when order is delivered
6. **Background Support**: Continues tracking even when app is minimized

## 🔍 Debugging

Check console logs for these messages:
- `🚀 Order status changed to in_transit, starting location tracking...`
- `📍 Location update sent for order:`
- `🛑 Order completed, stopping location tracking...`

## 📱 Testing on Device

**Important**: Location tracking only works on physical devices, not emulators.

1. Install app on physical device
2. Grant location permissions when prompted
3. Test with real delivery orders
4. Monitor network requests to verify location data is sent

## 🎯 Website Integration

The sent location data can be used on your website to:
- Draw delivery paths on Google Maps
- Show real-time driver location
- Calculate delivery ETAs
- Generate delivery reports

Your backend should store the location data and provide it to your website dashboard for real-time tracking visualization.
